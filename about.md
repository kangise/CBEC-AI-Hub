## 🌟 Why CBEC-AI-Hub Exists

### The Cross-Border Challenge

Cross-border e-commerce is fundamentally different from domestic e-commerce:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); gap: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
  
  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #e74c3c; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <h4>🚚 Logistics Complexity</h4>
    <p>Long shipping times, high costs, unpredictable last-mile delivery, and complex routing optimization.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #f39c12; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <h4>📋 Regulatory Maze</h4>
    <p>Dynamic tariffs, complex import taxes, varying product standards, HS code classification, and data privacy laws.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <h4>🌐 Cultural Barriers</h4>
    <p>Multiple languages, diverse payment methods, currency fluctuations, and varying cultural preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #9b59b6; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <h4>💳 Payment Risks</h4>
    <p>Multi-currency transactions, exchange rate volatility, and sophisticated cross-border fraud patterns.</p>
  </div>
